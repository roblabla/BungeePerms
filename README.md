BungeePerms
===========

a permissions plugin for BungeeCord

BungeePerms overrides the built-in permissions system of BungeeCord so you don't need BungeeCord permissions (anymore).


Important notice:

You need at least a BungeeCord build #327 or higher



Functionality:

- permission groups
- extra permissions despite the groups permissions for different users
- promote/demote functionality
- in-game permission modification (add/remove/list)
- in-game permission check (check a user's/group's permission)
- in-game list for defined users/groups
- reload function to reload permissions from the permissions file
- group inharitances
